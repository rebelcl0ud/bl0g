        <p>I have stacks of scribbles-- drawings, words, songs, books, things to do, things to get, stuff to look into, stuff I've learned, stuff I'm learning, etc. Unfortunately, much of the time I look back through them they end up reading like a collection of hieroglyphics.</p>

        <p>So, now I write as I work on a seperate window in Sublime- those files, although a bit scattered, are readable. Sorta.</p>

        <p>My intention: migrate those Sublime files into blog posts not only for easier access and better readability, but perhaps to better solidify what I may have learned in the process.</p>

        <p>I write for me, but if someone stumbles upon this and gets helped and/or entertained smiles I'd find that pretty rad.</p>
