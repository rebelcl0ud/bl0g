                    I have stacks of scribbles-- drawings, words, songs, books,
                    things to do, things to get, stuff to look into, stuff
                    I&apos;ve learned, stuff I&apos;m learning, etc.
                    Unfortunately, much of the time I look back through them
                    they end up reading like a collection of hieroglyphics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, I try to write as I work on a seperate window in <del>Sublime</del> VS Code-
                    those files, although a bit scattered, are readable. Sorta.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My intention: migrate my many notes into VS Code to turn into blog posts
                    not only for easier access and better readability, but
                    perhaps to better solidify what I may have learned in the
                    process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I write for me, but if someone stumbles upon this and gets
                    helped and/or entertained /smiles I&apos;d find that pretty
                    rad.
