                    I have stacks of scribbles-- drawings, words, songs, books,
                    things to do, things to get, stuff to look into, stuff
                    I&apos;ve learned, stuff I&apos;m learning, etc.
                    Unfortunately, much of the time I look back through them
                    they end up reading like a collection of hieroglyphics.

                    My intention: migrate my many notes into VS Code to turn
                    into blog posts not only for easier access and better
                    readability, but perhaps to better solidify what I learned
                    in the process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I write for me, but if someone stumbles upon this and gets
                    helped and/or entertained <i>/smiles</i> I&apos;d find that
                    pretty rad.
