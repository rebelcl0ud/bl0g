Save early, save often.

How many of us have heard some form of that sentence?

Now, how many of us, at some point, have wanted to do (or actually done) a face plant for not doing that very thing? 🙋‍♀️

Last week, I posted of my Mac woes that ultimately led me to the Windows subsystem for Linux (🥰). The part that I didn’t include, the Mac that recently died, had not been backed up.

Yea…

Most things I can live without, what is life if not impermanence?

Still, I wanted to try and revive it (if there was a chance), at the very least, to back up whatever was on there. So, I got to looking up what I could do and, of course, went down a rabbit hole. In the end, I decided that I would try and do it myself. Simply, I refuse to buy a new, well anything electronic unnecessarily.

My theory, the battery needed to be swapped out.

So, I got a battery and some extra tools just in case because, well, Apple.

Finally, these things arrived and I got to it. Until I came across a screw that just refused to come out. Respect, but also COME OUT.

Down the rabbit hole once more, I tried all the things. Oh, but that super glue and drill nonsense? Yea, no. I’m not gonna do that. But, I did come across a couple of tools I didn’t have that looked promising.

I won’t lie to y’all. I wanted to throw this thing into the SUN and watch it disintegrate.

The additional tools finally arrived. I tried again, and, although it was not a straightforward success, I was successful. Goodbye little T whatever number screw it was. Onward!

So much nonsense to unscrew and remove and blah blah blah just to get to the battery with death grip adhesive. 😑

The back door had to be opened, I was hot. I got up to walk in circles as I messaged people. Basically, doing a monologue talking to myself because most of these people know nothing of what I’m talking about because they would never open a laptop in that manner because they use laptops for basically nothing other than emails. _/takes deep breath_

I lit a candle.

In the end, I did swap out that battery. Alas, this is no tale of joy, but one of caution. There is no mirth nor happy ending to be found. Take heed, for this lesson is wrapped in woe, and those who ignore it may find themselves in its peril. Save ye early, save ye oft, for in neglect lies ruin.

sn: I wrote this last night. I decided to not rage post and give it a once over today... you know, to make sure it wasn't all RAWR 😂 anywaaay...

Save early, save often, and that includes backing up your stuff. 🖖
