I’ve been curious about Remix for some time, and finally decided to do something about that. I was writing little notes here and there as I came across things and (unsuccessfully consistent) writing summaries of woes and triumphs post-session. Mostly non-linear. So, I decided to dedicate some time to writing something linear before I carry on.

This is one of [?] parts, but since it’s the most complete in comparison, I guess “set for press” it is.

Sometimes your face melts because you only see it after, well, your face melts😂 or recently, in my case, felt the descent into madness.

So, what was it?

File naming.

Ridiculous, but true.

Remix has a certain way of naming files that can be a bit confusing at first, well, at least to me. I took a stab at doing a basic setup of routes from memory since the naming thing tripped me up when I first read it. I got pretty close. Most of what I wanted to show up did, except one file.

I decided to hop on chatGPT. I assumed it was something small I happened to miss and thought it’d be quicker (spoiler: it was not). Instead, I ended up testing out suggestions because I was continuously told I was wrong on my initial naming/folder structure and that’s why it wasn’t working. I was down to try the suggestions out though because why not.

sn: I don’t use chatGPT much due to the amount of resources it seems to use, but I’m also not opposed to its existence and the fact it can be super helpful. I have to say though this was the first time I experienced the descent into madness together.

Our chat went in circles. It basically kept repeating what it “thought” was correct. I responded that what I had initially had me closer with less stuff than it was suggesting. We went back and forth. I ended up stepping away to take a closer look at the docs and once again I got it close to working (as expected). So, I tried again (with chatGPT). Again, circles. Finally, losing patience, but appreciative it was trying to help me out 🤖🫂, since it just kept repeating itself even when presented with new info I went back to the docs. Finally, although it didn’t explicitly show me the answer, I realized something. Y’all, I was missing an underscore in the one file that wasn’t showing up as expected.😂 I, of course, went back to chatGPT and was like, “bro, I got it working, it was an underscore!”. We celebrated, it was nice.

Moral of the story: no one is immune to typos. ✨🖖

Q: Do you really call chatGPT bro?
A: I'd have to check chats, but probably. I’m from Miami. We call everyone bro, it’s ageless and genderless, let us live.
