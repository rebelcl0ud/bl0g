Have you ever been typing and then realized your typing is a mess?

Recently, I thought I may have been going wild on the keys because, well, typos. However, as I started "fixing" these typos I noticed it wasn’t my typing (not entirely). In fact, I was in 'overtype' mode.

Overtype mode? Yep and it causes the cursor to delete the next letter as you type. I didn’t even know it had a name 😅, found my answer DuckDuckGo-ing something along the lines of "what is up with my cursor deleting characters" (yes sometimes I search for things like I’m talking, whatever, let me live).

So, what was the fix? Press that 'Insert' key and all will be right with the world once more.

I remember this happening before, but it was so long ago I had forgotten how to toggle it off. Maybe next time I’ll remember 🤷🏻‍♀️, but more importantly perhaps this saves someone time of having to look it up when it happens. ✨🖖
