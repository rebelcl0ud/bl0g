title: "Remix - Tailwind"

Sometimes, I like to switch things up. I tend to gravitate towards the â€˜visualâ€™ so the majority of the time I start something I prioritize styling things out and yet, Iâ€™ve recently been totally avoiding doing any of that.

However, after I got something decent to build off of I did add Tailwind. With that said, I kept it pretty basic (for now). The thing is, itâ€™s too easy for me to get sucked into 'making things pretty', but having a general layout and placement of things helps with â€˜organizationâ€™ in my mind.

I must say, ignoring the CSS side of things more, Iâ€™ve forgotten stuff â€“ my â€˜duhâ€™ moment was trying to make sure all the â€˜folder tabsâ€™ matched size no matter textâ€¦ I forgot the â€˜blockâ€™ on my <NavLink>ðŸ˜… (yay for the Interwebz)

I got 2 more posts incoming and Iâ€™ll be â€˜caught upâ€™, I think ðŸ™ƒ

â€¦Happy Friday the 13th yâ€™all. âœ¨ðŸ––
