# Another form?

Yes, yes. I actually already built register and login forms, the latter actually pissing me off while writing tests ðŸ˜… so of course I decided to build another form I've had on the todo list-- hello , addRecipe form.
At this point, I really have no idea if I've talked about why I started building this app, but basically there's a household in danger of being swallowed whole by a collection of recipes.
I thought it would be a good opportunity to use/learn Remix and touch some backend-ish stuff while working on something that would organize that recipe chaos.

## Details? What details?

So yea, when I build stuff I sketch stuff out (I like to "doodle", what can I say?) and it works alright... well, enough to get me out of my own way and start building something.
But then, of course, there comes a time that you build and look and then recall and ultimately realize/decide "s\*\*\*, that's not gonna work." and that's what happened to me while building this part lol
I realized that (with the db in mind + UX) I needed to put a little more thought into how exactly this form should go. Not just for my present self, but for my future self annnd my self that would want to use this dang thing.

### Trello?

These are the times I find myself going back and forth about whether I should have used something like Trello to write out the overall picture and then start drilling down into the details, but then I rememeber
although I dig organization I may go down a rabbit hole and essentially get so sucked into that I'd probably keep pushing the build start.
It's like researching (insert w.e here) at some point you gotta go try and do the thing!

## I'll be back

So, I have another backlog of docs to write (for my weekly LI posts-- trying to get into the habit of doing that) and haven't gone past much more than outline for each "post". Those are about authentication/etc.
This one would have started another "chunk", but since it's fresh and I'm about to put into practice what I decided on I figured I'd get this little "wip/draft" started.
