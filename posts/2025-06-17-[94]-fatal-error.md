Every time I see ‘fatal’ I think of a Mortal Kombat (🤩Raiden)

```
fatal: the remote end hung up unexpectedly. Connection to github[dot]com closed by remote host.
fatal: Could not read from remote repository. Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists.
```

FATALITY (said in Mortal Kombat tone, obviously)

Then, of course, troubleshooting commences.

Test connection:

> `ssh -T git[at]github[dot]com`
>
> Hi [your-username]! You've successfully authenticated…

If this fails or hangs forevs you’ll know there’s an SSH issue.

Check VPN/Internet:

> Disconnect VPN and try another ‘push’
> Check Internet hasn’t pooped out, swap network or try a hotspot

The latter was actually my issue. The internet apparently decides to sometimes take a nap late evenings/early mornings. At first, I didn't realize this was my issue and thought something happened to the keys or I don’t know… not my internet! 😅 (thank you, hotspot).

This was a good reminder to push frequently. I had added/committed, but hadn’t pushed anything up to that point. This isn’t something I do so not sure why I randomly started collecting commits, but not letting them ‘leave the nest’ 😅 – Happy to report this is no longer the case and have not encountered these (prepare Mortal Kombat tone here) _fatality_ type errors as of late.

“Fun Fact”: watching the Panthers vs Oilers game tonight (Go Panthers!), that 5th goal had me thinking it may turn out to be a _FLAWLESS VICTORY_ 😁 – it was not meant to be (5-1), but it did prompt this train of thought– Mortal Kombat > fatality > fatal > post.
