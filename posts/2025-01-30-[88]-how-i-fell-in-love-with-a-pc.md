Developing on a Windows machine hurts my heart.

Well, that’s how I used to feel.

I remember when I first started, I had a Mac from uni that I set up. During that time I came across quite a bit of posts saying Macs were less of a headache to set up, I figured I lucked out.

Not long after, however, the Mac started glitching. Thankfully, I had built myself a PC a year or so before for compositing work (and perhaps some gaming 😅). I got it set up, but I remember it being an unpleasant experience in comparison (ah, that must have been what those internet people were talking about).

After some time, I got my hands on a Mac through work and, again, what a difference. I was able to purchase it (the company would swap them out after a certain time, but give the option to snag it at discount) and used it until it finally died on me in October last year. Once again, although begrudgingly, I turned to another PC.

I was skeptical this time would be any different. Some things are just not meant to be, you know.

I had tried again post desktop and then again when I was sent one for a contract role.

I had no reason to be optimistic, but I went for it and did it anyway.

This time, however, I set up the Windows subsystem for Linux.

Yea… if you’re reading this and know… then, 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘬𝘯𝘰𝘸.

“Praise the sun”

Finally, y'all, my heart smiled.

Now, I imagine some of y'all saying something like, “wait, I thought this was gonna be about Windows, but instead it’s about Linux making you happy?”.

Yes.

Moral of the story:
The answer to life, the universe and everything may be 42, but will probably never be Windows.
