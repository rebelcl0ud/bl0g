I've hooked up a handful of projects to Vercel and each time I forget how I did it the last time so this is for future me.

First, do you have your code on Github? If so, fantastic. If not, do that now. Then head over to Vercel.

- Login to Vercel and go to projects sections.
- Overview > Add new projects.
- See your repo on the list? Probably not, I like to only give permissions as I go.
- There should be a link nearby where you can adjust Github app permission, click that.
- A window should have popped up, scroll down to repo access. Like mentioned before you don't give full access so go to *only select repos* and look for the repo you want to now include in the dropdown. Locate it and save.
- You should have been redirected back to your list of projects to import and your newly added repo should be on that list.
- Import the repo and follow steps to configure.
- Donezo. That's it.

Until next time...
