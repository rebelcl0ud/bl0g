I didn’t use ‘npx create-remix@latest’. Why? Well, the thing is I am fully aware that it’s like any quick setup where a whole bunch of stuff gets done for me, but like where’s the suffering in that? Jest aside, it’s not something I do often, I just like to try and put things together myself sometimes. But, alas, I digress.

I’m trying to get consistent with posting at least once a week– I’ve totally procrastinated on coherent summaries so here’s another chunk to add to the recent series. Not sure this one will be very entertaining😅nonetheless, onward…

Dependencies. Somehow in installing all the things a dependency conflict occurred, the React version wasn’t the version expected. I suppose it makes sense one would get the latest version if unspecified. I ended up pinning the version to avoid further conflicts, however, I did realize I was getting warnings at first, but when one of those installs introduced a more complex dependency tree I suppose it had enough and that’s when it decided to yell at me, understandably so because you know, boundaries.⛔

.gitignore. Sometimes I forget to add this before I ‘git init’ things. No worries, git can giveth and git can taketh away. Just needed to look that up because I don’t remember all things git. In general, you’ll end up remembering things you use the most and even then you’ll probably need to double check sometimes. Speaking of git, looking at you ‘git –amend –no-edit’.

In doing this, (probably unrelated, although not to my brain) I recalled a time I started a project on Mac and then went to pick it back up on a PC and I got all this end of line nonsense. There are ways to get that sorted and standardized across editors/OS; ‘.editorconfig’, ‘.gitattributes’, I think even in your ‘.prettierrc’ file. Hmm, maybe this was random. Whatever. I thought it as I went along so here it is.😅

Okay, so I got a basic setup going, some basic routes, cool. Presently it’s JSX, no hate, but I want TSX in my life.

Well, that was a nightmare. 😀 ← this is actually where I stopped at the time.

Now that I’m back fleshing this post out, not sure why I felt that way. I guess that’s what happens when you return to something after-the-fact. So, what were some of the trip-ups? While swapping the JS to TS in my server file, although mostly straightforward, I did run into type errors and then there was the splitting of the ‘tsconfig’ files. I kept the initial one for the dev side of things, made another one for the build, and then those files extend a base file that consists of what’s shared between the other two. Mainly, running ‘dev’ there is no JS output, while ‘build’ generates JS files for deployment. Oh, there was also a typo in the build script (typos: 2, me: 0).
